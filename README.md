# DupeFinder

I built this project in order to help some photographer friends out with some of their photo editing as they would often save multiple similar photos with filters on them or different resolutions that online duplicate searchers didn't find. 

This is a program that runs a hashing algorithm to look for duplicate photos in folders. The GUI is written using PyQt5. 

**SETUP**

Download all the files as a zip and make sure all of the files are in the same folder and run GUI.py. 

You should see this window

Either hit Browse Folder or File -> Open Folder to select the folder you want to look for duplicates. 

Use the Similarity Slider in order to select the similarity you would like to set it to, then hit Find Duplicates to search the Folder you have selected. 

You should find a screen that looks like this.

You can hit Show Image to open up the image in whatever image finder you have on your computer.

Use the checkboxes to select which files you would like to delete, and click Delete Selected when you are done
